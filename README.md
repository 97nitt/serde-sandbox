# Serde Sandbox

This repo serves as a playground for demonstrating different data serialization formats. Specifically, you will find
examples of the following formats:

- [JSON](https://www.json.org/)
- [Avro](https://avro.apache.org/)
- [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers)

At this time, all examples are in [Java](java), but each of these formats can be used in a wide variety of programming languages.
